 🧠 Gesture-Controlled Tower of Hanoi 🎮

This project is an interactive, real-time version of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle controlled entirely with hand gestures using a webcam. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, it tracks your hand movements and allows you to pick and place discs with just a pinch gesture.

 📌 Features

✋ Real-time Hand Gesture Detection using MediaPipe
<br>
🧩 Interactive Tower of Hanoi gameplay
<br>
🕐 Tracks time taken to complete the puzzle
<br>
🎉 Confetti animation when the puzzle is solved
<br>
🎮 No mouse or keyboard—just your hand and a webcam!

 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python
<br>
OpenCV – for webcam access and rendering visuals
<br>
MediaPipe – for accurate and efficient hand landmark tracking
<br>
Math/Random Modules– for gesture math & animations
<br>
CV2 GUI – to render the game environment

 🎮 How to Play

1. Start the program – your webcam window will open.
2. Use your thumb and index finger to pinch (like picking up something).
3. Move your hand left or right to choose a tower.
4. Pinch to pick a disk, unpinch to drop it onto a valid rod.
5. Complete the puzzle by moving all disks to the rightmost rod in correct order.
6. 🎊 Celebrate with confetti once you win!
